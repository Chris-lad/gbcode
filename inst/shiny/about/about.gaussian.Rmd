### Univariate standard
Goal: computation of the probability mass associated to the interval (inner or outer).




### Bivariate

Goal: computation of the probability mass associated to the interval (inner or outer).

* Slider $\lambda_1$: 1st eigenvalue of covariance matrix (variance along first axis) 
* Slider $\lambda_2$: 2nd eigenvalue of covariance matrix (variance along second axis) 
* Slider rotation : rotation angle $\alpha$ of  covariance matrix

Note that the diagonal matrix corresponds to $\lambda_1=\lambda_2=1$ and $\theta=0$.



Suggested manipulations:

* by acting on the sliders, you can change the axis size and the rotation of the bivariate gaussian distribution.
The associate covariance matrix and the eigenvalues change accordingly.
